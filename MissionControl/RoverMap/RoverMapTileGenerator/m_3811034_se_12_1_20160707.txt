    Description:
      Abstract:
        This data set contains imagery from the National Agriculture
        Imagery Program (NAIP).  The NAIP program is administered by
        USDA FSA and has been established to support two main FSA
        strategic goals centered on agricultural production.
        These are, increase stewardship of America's natural resources
        while enhancing the environment, and to ensure commodities
        are procured and distributed effectively and efficiently to
        increase food security.  The NAIP program supports these goals by
        acquiring and providing ortho imagery that has been collected
        during the agricultural growing season in the U.S. The NAIP
        ortho imagery is tailored to meet FSA requirements and is a
        fundamental tool used to support FSA farm and conservation
        programs.  Ortho imagery provides an effective, intuitive
        means of communication about farm program administration
        between FSA and stakeholders.  
        New technology and innovation is identified by fostering and
        maintaining a relationship with vendors and government
        partners, and by keeping pace with the broader geospatial
        community.  As a result of these efforts the NAIP program
        provides three main products: DOQQ tiles,
        Compressed County Mosaics (CCM), and Seamline shape files
        The Contract specifications for NAIP imagery have changed
        over time reflecting agency requirements and improving
        technologies.  These changes include image resolution,
        horizontal accuracy, coverage area, and number of bands.
        In general, flying seasons are established by FSA and are
        targeted for peak crop growing conditions.  The NAIP
        acquisition cycle is based on a minimum 3 year refresh of base
        ortho imagery.  The tiling format of the NAIP imagery is based
        on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 pixel buffer
        on all four sides.  NAIP quarter quads are formatted to the UTM
        coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983.
        NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.
      Purpose:
        NAIP imagery is available for distribution within 60 days
        of the end of a flying season and is intended to provide current
        information of agricultural conditions in support of USDA farm
        programs. For USDA Farm Service Agency, the 1 meter and 1/2 meter
        GSD product provides an ortho image base for Common Land Unit
        boundaries and other data sets.  The 1 meter and 1/2 meter NAIP
        imagery is generally acquired in projects covering full states in
        cooperation with state government and other federal agencies that
        use the imagery for a variety of purposes including land use
        planning and natural resource assessment.  The NAIP is also used 
        for disaster response.  While suitable for a variety of uses,
        prior to 2007 the 2 meter GSD NAIP imagery was primarily intended
        to assess "crop condition and compliance" to USDA farm program
        conditions. The 2 meter imagery was generally acquired only
        for agricultural areas within state projects.

          NAIP horizontal accuracy specifications have evolved over
          the life of the program.  From 2003 to 2004 the
          specifications were as follows: 1-meter GSD imagery was
          to match within 3-meters, and 2-meter GSD to match within 10
          meters of reference imagery.  For 2005 the 1-meter GSD
          specification was changed to 5 meters matching the reference
          imagery.  In 2006 a pilot project was performed using true
          ground specifications rather than reference imagery.  All
          states used the same specifications as 2005 except Utah,
          which required a match of +/- 6 meters to true ground.
          In 2007 all specifications were the same as 2006 except
          Arizona used true ground specifications and all other states
          used reference imagery.  In 2008 and subsequent years
          no 2-meter GSD imagery was acquired and all specifications
          were the same as 2007 except approximately half of the
          states acquired used true ground specifications and the
          other half used reference imagery.  The 2008 states that
          used absolute ground control where; Indiana, Minnesota,
          New Hampshire, North Carolina, Texas, Vermont, and Virginia.
          From 2009 to present all NAIP imagery acquisitions used
          the +/- 6 meters to ground specification.

          DOQQ Production Process Description
          USDA FSA APFO NAIP Program 2014
          State: Oregon
          
                  Digital imagery was collected at a nominal GSD of 40cm
                  using seven Cessna 441 aircraft flying at an average
                  flight height of 5000m AGL. All aircraft flew with
                  Leica Geosystem's ADS100/SH100 digital sensors with
                  firmware 4.12. Each sensor collected 12
                  image bands.  Red,Green,Blue and Near-infrared at
                  each of three look angles; Backward 19 degrees,
                  Forward 26 degrees and Nadir. The Nadir Green band
                  was collected in high resolution mode effectively 
                  doubling the resolution for that band.  
                  The ADS100 spectral ranges are; Red 619-651nm,Green
                  525-585nm,Blue 435-495nm and Near-infrared at
                  808-882nm. The CCD arrays have a pixel size of 5.0
                  microns in a 20000x1 format at nadir; a 18000x1
                  format at the backward look angle and a 16000x1 format
                  at the forward look angle.     
                  The CCD's have a dynamic range of 72db and the A/D
                  converters have a resolution of 14bits.
                  The ADS is a push-broom sensor and the ground
                  footprint of the imagery at a nominal GSD of 40cm
                  is approximately 8km wide by the length flightline.
                  The maximum flightline length is limited to approximately
                  240km. The factory calibrations and IMU alignments for
                  each sensor (Serial Numbers: 10512,10514,10519,
                  10521,10526,10527,10528) were tested and verified by
                  in-situ test flights before the start of the project.
                  The Leica MissionPro Flight Planning Software is used
                  to develop the flight acquisition plans.     
                  Flight acquisition sub blocks are designed first to
                  define the GNSS base station logistics, and to break
                  the project up into manageable acquisition units. The
                  flight acquisition sub blocks are designed based on
                  the specified acquisition season, native UTM zone of
                  the DOQQs, flight line length limitations (to ensure
                  sufficient performance of the IMU solution) as well
                  as air traffic restrictions in the area. Once the sub
                  blocks have been delineated they are brought into MissionPro
                  for flight line design. The design parameters used in
                  MissionPro will be 30% lateral overlap and 40cm resolution.
                  The flight lines have been designed with a north/south
                  orientation. The design takes into account the
                  latitude of the state, which affects line spacing due
                  to convergence as well as the terrain. SRTM elevation
                  data is used in the MissionPro design to ensure the 50cm
                  GSD is achieved over all types of terrain.
                  The raw data was downloaded from the sensors after
                  each flight using Leica XPro software. The imagery was
                  then georeferenced using the 200Hz GPS/INS data
                  creating an exterior orientation for each scan line
                  (x/y/z/o/p/k). Leica Xpro APM software was used to
                  automatically generate tiepoint measurements between
                  the foward 26 degree, nadir and backward 19 degree look 
                  angles for each line and to tie all flight lines together.
                  The resulting point data and exterior orientation data
                  were used to perform a full bundle adjustment using ORIMA
                  software. Blunders were removed, and additional tie points
                  measured in weak areas to ensure a robust solution.
                  Once the point data was clean and point coverage was
                  acceptable, photo-identifiable GPS-surveyed ground
                  control points were introduced into the block
                  adjustment. The bundle adjustment process produces
                  revised exterior orientation data for the sensor with
                  GPS/INS, datum, and sensor calibration errors modeled
                  and removed. Using the revised exterior orientation
                  from the bundle adjustment, orthorectified image
                  strips were created with Xpro software and the June
                  2014 USGS 10m NED DEM. The Xpro orthorectification
                  software applies an atmospheric-BRDF radiometric
                  correction to the imagery. This correction compensates
                  for atmospheric absorption, solar illumination angle
                  and bi-directional reflectance. The orthorectified
                  strips were then overlaid with each other and the
                  ground control to check accuracy. Once the accuracy of
                  the orthorectified image strips were validated the
                  strips were then imported into Inpho's OrthoVista 5.7
                  package which was used for the final radiometric
                  balance, mosaic, and DOQQ sheet creation. The final
                  DOQQ sheets, with a 300m buffer and a ground pixel
                  resolution of 1 meter were then combined and compressed
                  to create the county wide CCMs.
