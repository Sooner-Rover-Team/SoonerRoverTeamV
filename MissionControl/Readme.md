This is all the code for either programs running on the mission control computers (python_drive) or the rover's onboard computer (video_streamer).

***This code is useless***

It will be left in the repo for the moment but all of its functionality is available in python_drive

## python_drive

Documentation is inside the folder.

## video_streamer
